<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides recommended use cases for <%= vars.product_name %>
and information for determining the product's fit for your enterprise's use case.

## <a id="usecases"></a> Recommended Use Cases

On-Demand plans are configured by default for cache use cases but can also be used
as a datastore.

Shared-VM plans are designed for datastore use cases in testing or development environments.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Shared-VM service should only be used for development and testing.
   Do not use for production.</p>

Redis can be used in many different ways, including:

* Key/value store: For strings and more complex data structures including Hashes, Lists, Sets, and Sorted Sets
* Session cache: Persistence enabled preservation of state
* Full page cache: Persistence enabled preservation of state
* Database cache: Middle-tier database caching to speed up common queries
* Data ingestion: Because Redis is in memory, it can ingest data very quickly
* Message queues: List and set operations. `PUSH`, `POP`, and blocking queue commands.
* Leaderboards and counting: Increments and decrements sets and sorted sets
  using `ZRANGE`, `ZADD`, `ZREVRANGE`, `ZRANK`, `INCRBY`, and `GETSET`
* Pub/Sub: Built in publish and subscribe operations: `PUBLISH`, `SUBSCRIBE`, and `UNSUBSCRIBE`

## <a id="benchmarks"></a> SLO Benchmark

The <%= vars.product_name %> team maintains a monthly Service Level Objective (SLO) of 99.95%
uptime for the <%= vars.product_name %> offering on Pivotal Web Services.
This is provided as a benchmark. SLOs for separate offerings of the Redis for
PCF service vary based on variables such as infrastructure, networking, and
relevant policies around security upgrades.

## <a id="offerings"></a> Service Offerings

For descriptions of the <%= vars.product_name %> service offerings, see:

* [On-Demand Service Offering](./architecture.html)
* [Shared-VM Service Offering](./architecture-pp.html)

Review the following table to determine if <%= vars.product_name %> has the features needed to support your enterprise.

  <tr>
    <td>Availability</td>
    <td>All <%= vars.product_name %> services are single VMs without clustering capabilities.
        This means that planned maintenance jobs (e.g., upgrades) can result in 2â€“10 minutes of downtime,

        Unplanned downtime (e.g., VM failure) also affects the Redis service.<br>
        <%= vars.product_name %> has been used successfully in enterprise-ready apps that can tolerate downtime.
        Pre-existing data is not lost during downtime with the default persistence configuration.
        Successful apps include those where the downtime is passively handled or
        where the app handles failover logic.

    Operators can configure the number of VMs and the size of those VMs.
    For the On-Demand service, the operator does this by creating plans with specific VM sizes and quotas for each plan.
    For the Shared-VM service, the number and size of VMs are pre-provisioned by the operator.
    BOSH errands used for registration, upgrade and cleanup use short-lived VMs that cannot be configured but can be
    turned on or off.

    To prevent data loss, only scaling up is supported.
    For the Shared-VM Service, the operators can change the Redis instance memory limit as well as change the instance limit.

### <a id="other-notes"></a>Availability Zones

<%= vars.product_name %> supports configuring multiple availability zones (AZs).
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis service instances does not provide high availability.
This is because each individual Redis service instance is a single VM without
clustering capabilities.

+ On-Demand plans can be configured to deploy service instances to any AZ.
  If you select multiple AZs, service instances are distributed randomly between them.
  This improves resiliency.
+ Shared-VM service instances run on a single VM in the AZ in which the tile is deployed.
