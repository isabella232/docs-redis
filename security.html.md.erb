## <a id="security"></a> Security

To allow this service to have network access you must create application security groups (ASGs).
For more information, see [Networks, Security, and Assigning AZs](./installing.html#azs).

Pivotal recommends the following best practices for security:

* Run <%= vars.product_name %> in its own network.
For more information, see [Creating Networks in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/customizing/gcp-om-config.html#network).

* Use <%= vars.product_name %> with the IPsec Add-on for PCF.
For information about the IPsec Add-on for PCF, see [Securing Data in Transit with the IPsec Add-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html).

* Do not use a single <%= vars.product_name %> instance for multi-tenancy.
A single Redis instance of the On-Demand service should only support a single workload.

* Do not use the Shared-VM service for production use cases. It is not considered adequately secure for that purpose, even though it is designed for multi-tenancy.

* Set TLS to **Optional** and encourage app developers to make use of the TLS port.
  For more information, see [Using TLS](./appdevs.html#using-tls).
