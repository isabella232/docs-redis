<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic lists troubleshooting information for Redis for PCF.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
  Some of the troubleshooting approaches in this topic suggest potentially destructive operations.
  Pivotal recommends that you back up both your Ops Manager and deployments before attempting such operations.
  <br><br>
  For more information about backing up your setup and exporting your Ops Manager installation,
  see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html">Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR</a>
</p>


## <a id="debugging"></a> Useful Debugging Commands

Before debugging, gather the following about your PCF deployment:

* Current version of Redis for PCF, and, if upgrading, the previous version of Redis for PCF
* Current version of Ops Manager, and, if upgrading, the previous version of Ops Manager

You can obtain general information after you SSH into a broker or service instance as follows:

* To see system logs, go to `/var/vcap/sys/log`.
* To check process health, run `sudo monit summary`.
* To obtain a list of all processes, run `ps aux`.
* To see disk usage, run `df -h`.
* To see memory usage, run `free -m`.

You can obtain information specific to the cf-redis broker as follows:

* For shared-VMs, the redis processes are co-located with the CF-Redis broker.
  You can check these VMs using `ps aux | grep redis-server`.
* Shared-VM data is stored in `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/redis-data`.


## <a id="redis-cli"></a> About the Redis CLI

The redis-cli is a command line tool used to access a Redis server.
You can use the redis-cli for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) actions,
and to set configuration values.
For more information about the redis-cli, see [redis-cli, the Redis command
line interface](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli) in the Redis documentation.

To access the redis-cli, do the following:

1. Follow the instructions in [Access the Redis Service](./using.html#call)
to retrieve the password and port number for the service instance.

1. SSH into the service instance.

1. Connect to the Redis server and enter the redis-cli interactive mode by running:

    ```
    /var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli -p PORT -a PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>PORT</code> is the port number retrieved in step one.</li>
      <li><code>PASSWORD</code> is the password retrieved in step one.</li>
    </ul>
    For more information about the redis-cli interactive mode, see
    [Interactive Mode](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli#interactive-mode) in the
    Redis documentation.

### <a id="syslog-errors"></a> Error Messages Logged in Syslog

You can configure Redis for PCF with remote syslog forwarding.
For more information, see <a href="installing.html#syslog">Configure Syslog Forwarding</a>.

<br><br>

This section helps to troubleshoot the following errors logged in syslog:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#corrupt-aof">AOF File Corrupted, Cannot Start Redis Instance</a></li>
  <li><a href="#disk-full">AOF Write or Rewrite Errors</a></li>
  <li><a href="#disk-size">Saving Error</a></li>
</ul>


#### <a id="corrupt-aof"></a>AOF File Corrupted, Cannot Start Redis Instance
<br>
<strong>Symptom</strong><br>

<br>
One or more VMs might fail to start the redis server during pre-start with the error message:<br>
<pre class="terminal">[ErrorLog-TimeStamp] # Bad file format reading the append only file: make a backup of your AOF file, then use ./redis-check-aof --fix `filename`</pre>
<br>

<strong>Explanation</strong><br><br>

In cases of hard crashes, for example, due to power loss or VM termination without
running drain scripts, your AOF file might become corrupted.
The error log printed out by Redis provides a clear means of recovery.
<br><br>

<strong>Solution for Shared-VM instances:</strong><br><br>
<ol>
  <li>SSH into your <code>cf-redis-broker</code> instance.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder where your AOF file is stored.
    This is usually
    <code>/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/redis-data/SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID/</code>, where
    <code>SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID</code> is the GUID for the affected service instance.
  </li>
  <li>Run the following command:
     <pre class="terminal">/var/vcap/packages/redis/redis-check-aof appendonly.aof --fix</pre>
  </li>
  <li>To SSH out of the <code>cf-redis-broker</code> instance and restart, run the following command:
     <pre>bosh restart INSTANCE-GROUP/INSTANCE-ID</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<strong>Solution for On-Demand-VM instances:</strong><br><br>
<ol>
  <li>SSH into your affected service instance.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder where your AOF file is stored.
    This is usually <code>/var/vcap/store/redis/</code>.</li>
  <li>Run the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">/var/vcap/packages/redis/redis-check-aof appendonly.aof --fix</pre>
  </li>
  <li>To SSH out of the service instance and restart it, run the following command:
     <pre>bosh restart INSTANCE-GROUP/INSTANCE-ID</pre>
  </li>
</ol>


#### <a id="disk-full"></a> AOF Write or Rewrite Errors
<br>
<strong>Symptom</strong><br><br>

One of the following error messages is logged:<br>

<pre class="terminal">Short write while writing to the AOF file</pre>
<pre class="terminal">Opening the temp file for AOF rewrite in rewriteAppendOnlyFile(): No space left on device</pre>
<pre class="terminal">Background AOF rewrite terminated with error</pre>
<br>

<strong>Explanation</strong><br><br>

This is logged when the Redis server is unable to append to the Redis append-only file (AOF).
The disk might be full.
<br><br>

<strong>Solution</strong><br><br>

For a short-term solution, do the following:<br><br>

<ol>
  <li>SSH into the affected Redis instance.</li>
  <li>Log into the <a href="#redis-cli">redis-cli</a>.</li>
  <li>Run <code>redis-cli CONFIG SET appendonly no</code> to disable AOF persistence.</li>
  <li>Delete the <code>/var/vcap/store/redis/appendonly.aof</code> file.</li>
  <li>Run <code>kill -HUP REDIS-SERVER-PID</code> to restart the Redis process.</li>
  <li>Run <code>redis-cli CONFIG SET appendonly yes</code> to re-enable AOF persistence.</li>
</ol>

For a long-term solution, upgrade to Redis for PCF v1.12 or later.
In older versions of the Redis for PCF tile, AOF persistence is enabled by default.
Upgrading to the latest version of the tile disables AOF persistence.


#### <a id="disk-size"></a>Saving Error<br>

<strong>Symptom</strong><br><br>

One of the following error messages is logged:<br>

<pre class="terminal">Background saving error</pre>
<pre class="terminal">Failed opening the RDB file dump.rdb (in server root dir /var/vcap/store/redis) for saving: No space left on device</pre>
<br>

<strong>Explanation</strong><br><br>

This might be logged when the configured disk size is too small,
or if the Redis AOF uses all the disk space.
<br><br>

<strong>Solution</strong><br><br>

To prevent this error, do the following:<br><br>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure the disk is configured to at least 2.5x the VM memory for the on-demand broker and 3.5x the VM memory for cf-redis-broker.</li>
  <li>Check if the AOF is using too much disk space by doing the following:
    <ol>
      <li>BOSH SSH into the affected service instance VM.</li><br>
      <li>Run <code>cd /var/vcap/store/redis; ls -la</code> to list the size of each file.</li><br>
      <li>If the <code>appendonly.aof</code> file is large, follow the instuctions
        in <a href="#disk-full">AOF Write or Rewrite Errors</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>


### <a id="backup-errors"></a> Failed Backup<br>

<strong>Symptom</strong><br><br>

The following error message is logged:<br>
<pre class="terminal">Backup has failed. Redis must be running for a backup to run</pre>
<br>

<strong>Explanation</strong><br><br>

This is logged if a backup is initiated against a Redis server that is down.
<br><br>

<strong>Solution</strong><br><br>
Ensure that the Redis server being backed up is running.
To do this, run <code>bosh restart</code> against the affected service instance VM.


### <a id="orphaned-instances"></a> Orphaned Instances

When a service instance is orphaned, one of the following occurs:<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>BOSH Director cannot see your service instances but PCF can. See
    <a href="#orphaned-bosh">BOSH Director Cannot See Your Instances</a>.</li>
  <li>PCF cannot see your broker or service instances but BOSH Director can. See
    <a href="#orphaned-pcf">PCF Cannot See Your Instances</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


#### <a id="orphaned-bosh"></a> BOSH Director Cannot See Your Instances<br>

<strong>Symptom</strong><br><br>

BOSH Director cannot see your instances but they are visible on PCF.
    When you run <code>cf curl /v2/service_instances</code>,
    some service instances are visible that are not visible to the BOSH Director.
    These orphaned instances can create issues.
    For example, they might hold on to a static IP address, causing IP conflicts.<br><br>

<strong>Explanation</strong><br><br>

Orphaned instances can occur in the following situations:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Both PCF and BOSH maintain state.
    Orphaned instances can occur if the PCF state is out of sync with BOSH.
    For example, the deployments or VMs have been deprovisioned by BOSH but
    the call to update the PCF state failed.</li>
  <li>If a call to deprovision a service instance was made directly to BOSH
    rather than through the cf CLI.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Solution</strong><br><br>
You can solve this issue by doing one of the following:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>If this is the first occurrence:</strong> Pivotal recommends that you purge
    instances by running
    <code>cf purge-service-instance SERVICE-INSTANCE</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>If this is a repeated occurrence:</strong> Contact
    <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/"> Pivotal Support</a>
    for further help, and include the following:
    <ul>
      <li>A snippet of your <code>broker.log</code> around the time of the incident</li>
      <li>The deployment manifest of failed instances, hiding private information like passwords</li>
      <li>Any recent logs that you can recover from the failed service instance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


#### <a id="orphaned-pcf"></a> PCF Cannot See Your Instances<br>

<strong>Symptom</strong><br><br>

PCF cannot see your broker or service instances.
These instances exist but PCF and apps cannot communicate with them.<br><br>

<strong>Explanation</strong><br><br>

If you run <code>cf purge-service-instances</code> while your service instance
or broker still exists, your service instance becomes orphaned.<br><br>

<strong>Solution</strong><br><br>

If PCF lost the details of your instances, but BOSH still has the deployment details,
you can solve this issue by backing up the data on your service instance and
creating a new service. <br><br>
To back up your data and create a new service instance, do the following:<br><br>
<ol>
  <li>To retrieve your orphaned service instance GUID, run the following command:
    <pre>bosh -d MY-DEPLOYMENT run-errand orphan-deployments</pre>
    Where <code>MY-DEPLOYMENT</code> is the name of your deployment.
  </li>

  <li>To SSH into your orphaned service instance, run the following command:
    <pre>bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT ssh VM-NAME/GUID</pre>
    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>MY-ENV</code> is the name of your environment.</li>
      <li><code>MY-DEPLOYMENT</code> is the name of your deployment.</li>
      <li><code>VM-NAME/GUID</code> is the name of your service instance and guid that you obtained
        in step 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>To create an new RDB file, run the following command:
    <pre>/var/vcap/jobs/redis-backups/bin/backup --snapshot</pre>
    This creates a new RDB file in <code>/var/vcap/store/redis-backup</code>.
  </li>

  <li>To push the RDB file to your backup location, run the following command:
    <pre>/var/vcap/jobs/service-backup/bin/manual-backup</pre>
    For information about backup locations,
    see <a href="./auto-backup.html">Configuring Automated Service Backups</a>.
  </li>

  <li>Create a new service instance with the same configuration of the database you backed up.</li>

  <li>To retrieve your new service instance GUID, run the following command:
    <pre>bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><code>MY-ENV</code> is the name of your environment.</li>
      <li><code>MY-DEPLOYMENT</code> is the name of your deployment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li> To SSH into your new service instance,
    repeat step 2 above with the GUID that you retrieved in step 6.</li>

  <li> To create a new directory in new service instance, run the following
    command:
    <pre>mkdir /var/vcap/store/MY-BACKUPS</pre>
  </li>

  <li> Save the RDB file in <code>/var/vcap/store/MY-BACKUPS/</code> to transfer it to the new instance.
     Replace <code>MY-BACKUPS</code> with the name of your backups directory.
  </li>

  <li>To verify the RDB file has not been corrupted, run the following command:
    <pre>md5sum RDB-FILE</pre>
    Where <code>RDB-FILE</code> is the path to your RDB file.
  </li>

  <li>To restore your data, run the following command:
    <pre>sudo /var/vcap/jobs/redis-backups/bin/restore --sourceRDB RDB-FILE</pre>
    Where <code>RDB-FILE</code> is the path to your RDB file.
  </li>
</ol>


### <a id="credhub-error"></a> Failed to Set Credentials in Runtime CredHub<br>

<strong>Symptom</strong><br><br>

If developers report errors such as:

<pre class="terminal">error: failed to set credentials in credential store: The request includes an unrecognized parameter 'mode'. Please update or remove this parameter and retry your request.. error for user: There was a problem completing your request. Please contact your operations team providing the following information: service: p.redis, service-instance-guid: , broker-request-id: , operation: bind</pre>

<strong>Explanation</strong><br><br>

Your service instances might not be running the latest version of Redis for PCF.
You might experience compatibility issues with CredHub if your service instances
are running Redis for PCF v1.14.3 or earlier.<br><br>

<strong>Solution</strong><br><br>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have the latest patch version of Redis for PCF installed.
  For more information about the latest patch, see <a href="./release.html">Redis for PCF Release Notes</a>.</li>
  <li>Run the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand to ensure all service
    instances are running the latest service offering.
     For how to run the errand, see <a href="#upgrade-all">Upgrade All Service Instances</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>
  Running this errand causes a short period of downtime.
