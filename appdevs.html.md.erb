This section introduces Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) services for developers
and links to more information.

For instructions on creating, binding to, and deleting an instance of the On-Demand,
or Shared-VM plan, see [Using Redis for PCF](./using.html).


## <a id="services"></a>  Redis for PCF Services

Redis for PCF v2.0 and later offers On-Demand and Shared-VM services.

* **On-Demand Service**---Provides a dedicated VM running a Redis instance.
  The operator can configure up to three plans with different configurations,
  memory sizes, and quotas.
  App developers can provision an instance for any of the On-Demand plans offered
  and configure certain Redis settings.

* **Shared-VM Service**---Provides support for a number of Redis instances running
  in a single VM.
  It is designed for testing and development purposes only, **do not use the
  Shared-VM service in production environments**.
  The Shared-VM instances are pre-provisioned by the operator with a fixed number
  of instances and memory size.
  App developers can then use one of these pre-provisioned instances.


<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong>
  If you use dedicated VMs, then migrate to the on-demand service plan
  or back up data before upgrading to Redis for PCF v2.0 to prevent data loss
  in Redis deployments used as persistent storage.<br><br>
  If you are upgrading from Redis for PCF v1.14.3 or earlier, you must run the
  <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand after upgrading.

For more information about the plans, see the [On-Demand Service Offering](./architecture.html)
and the [Shared-VM Service Offering](./architecture-pp.html).

##  <a id="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

### <a id="spring"></a>Using Redis for PCF with Spring

Spring Cloud Spring Service Connectors connect to Redis for PCF.
See the [Redis](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-spring-service-connector.html#_redis) section
in the Spring Cloud Spring Service Connector documentation.

Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry connectors automatically connect to Redis for PCF.
See the [Redis](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-cloud-foundry-connector.html#_redis) section
in the Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector documentation.

To view an example Spring app using Redis as a cache with failover,
see the [Redis Reference Architectures](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/redis-reference-architecture) repository.

### <a id="steeltoe"></a>Using Redis for PCF with Steeltoe

Steeltoe Cloud Connectors can connect to Redis for PCF.
See the [Steeltoe Cloud Connectors](https://steeltoe.io/docs/steeltoe-connectors/#5-0-redis) documentation.


To view examples of Steeltoe apps using Redis as a cache with failover,
see the <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-cf/RedisReferenceArchitectureSteeltoe">Example Steeltoe App</a>
repository in GitHub.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>:
  The Steeltoe connector for Redis requires Redis for PCF to support Lua scripting.
  Check whether the language you are using requires Lua scripting. If it does, contact your operator.
  By default, Lua scripting is disabled for Redis for PCF, but a PCF operator can
  change the setting to enable it by selecting the <strong>Lua Scripting</strong> checkbox in each service plan's <strong><a href="./installing.html#on-demand-plan-config">On-Demand Plan</a></strong> configuration pane.

###  <a id="pcf-dev"></a>PCF Dev
PCF Dev is a small footprint version of PCF that's small enough to run on a local
developer machine.
For more information, see https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev.
