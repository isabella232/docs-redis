<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>
    Dedicated-VMs have been deprecated and are removed when you upgrade to Redis for PCF v2.0.
    If you use your Redis deployments as persistent storage, Pivotal recommends that
    you back up data or migrate to on-demand instances before upgrading to v2.0.
    For how to migrate to on-demand instances, see
