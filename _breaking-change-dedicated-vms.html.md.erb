<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Dedicated VMs are absent from Redis for PCF v2.0.
    As of Redis for PCF v1.11, the on-demand service is at feature parity with the dedicated-VM service.
    Dedicated VMs are marked as deprecated in Redis for PCF v1.14.
    Pivotal recommends that you migrate to the on-demand service plan or back up data before upgrading to Redis for PCF v2.0 
    to prevent data loss in Redis deployments used as persistent storage. For information about migrating to on-demand service plans, see
