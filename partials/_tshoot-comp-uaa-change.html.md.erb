	If you have rotated any UAA user credentials then you may see authentication
	issues in the service broker logs.

	This provides the broker with the latest configuration.

    <strong>Note</strong>: You must ensure that any changes to UAA
    credentials are reflected in the Ops Manager <code>credentials</code>
    tab of the Pivotal Application Service tile.
