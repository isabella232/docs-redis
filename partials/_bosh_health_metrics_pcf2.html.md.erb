The BOSH layer that underlies Pivotal Cloud Foundry generates `healthmonitor` metrics for all VMs in the deployment.
As of Redis for PCF v2.0, these metrics are included in the Loggregator Firehose by default.
For more information, see [BOSH System Metrics Available in Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-metrics) in
<em> Pivotal Application Service Release Notes</em>.
