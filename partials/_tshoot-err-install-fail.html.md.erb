Reasons for a failed Redis installation include:

<ol>
  <li>
    Certificate issues: The on-demand broker (ODB) requires valid certificates.
    Ensure that your certificates are valid and generate new ones if necessary.
    To generate new certificates, contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io">Pivotal Support</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Deploy fails: Deploys can fail for a variety of reasons.
    View the logs using Ops Manager to determine why the deploy is failing.

  <ul>
    <li>Cloud Foundry cannot reach the Redis broker</li>
    <li>Cloud Foundry cannot reach the service instances</li>
    <li>The service network cannot access the BOSH director </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <a href="#register-broker">Register broker errand</a> fails.</li>

    Resource sizing issues: These occur when the resource sizes selected for a

    configuration matches that recommended by the service.
