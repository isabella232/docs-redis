<p>
  To determine whether there is an issue with  <%= vars.service_name_article_full %>
  deployment, inspect the VMs. To do so, run the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>bosh -d service-instance_GUID vms --vitals</code></pre>

<p>
  For additional information, run the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>bosh instances --ps --vitals</code></pre>

<p>
  If the VM is failing, follow the service-specific information.
  Any unadvised corrective actions (such as running BOSH <code>restart</code> on
  a VM) can cause issues in the service instance.
