<pre class="terminal">
Server error, status code: 504, error code: 10001, message: The request to the service broker timed out: https://BROKER-URL/v2/service_instances/e34046d3-2379-40d0-a318-d54fc7a5b13f/service_bindings/aa635a3b-ef6d-41c3-a23f-55752f3f651b

	Follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Confirm that Cloud Foundry (CF) is <a href="#network">connected to the service broker</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Check the BOSH queue size:
		<ol>
			<li>Log into BOSH as an admin.</li>
			<li>Run <code>bosh tasks</code>.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		If there are a large number of queued tasks, the system may be under too much load.
		BOSH is configured with two workers and one status worker, which may not be
		sufficient resources for the level of load.
		Advise app developers to try again once the system is under less load.
	</li>
</ol>
