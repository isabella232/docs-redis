  If no logs are being emitted by the on-demand broker, check that your syslog
  forwarding address is correct in Ops Manager.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure you have configured syslog for the tile.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure that you have network connectivity between the networks that the tile
      is using and the syslog destination.
      If the destination is external, you need to use the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/tile.html#public-ip">public ip</a>
      VM extension feature available in your Ops Manager tile configuration settings.

      Verify that Loggregator is emitting metrics:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Install the <code>cf log-stream</code> plugin.
          For instructions, see the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-stream-cli">Log Stream CLI Plugin</a>
          GitHub repository.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Find the GUID for your service instance by running:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre><code>cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE --guid</code></pre>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Find logs from your service instance by running:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre><code>cf log-stream | grep "SERVICE-GUID"</code></pre>
        </p>
  
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If no metrics appear within five minutes, verify that the broker network has access
  to the Loggregator system on all required ports.
