When you deploy <%= vars.platform_old %>, you must create a statically defined network to host
the component VMs that make up the <%= vars.platform_old %> infrastructure.
<%= vars.platform_old %> components, such as Cloud Controller and UAA, run on this infrastructure network.

On-demand <%= vars.platform_old %> services might require you to host them on a separate network
from the <%= vars.platform_old %> default network.
You can also deploy on-demand services on a separate service networks to meet your own security requirements.

<%= vars.platform_old %> supports dynamic networking.
Operators can use dynamic networking with asynchronous service provisioning to define
dynamically-provisioned service networks.
For more information, see [Default Network and Service Network](#on-demand) below.

On-demand services are enabled by default on all networks.
Operators can optionally create separate networks to host services in BOSH Director.
Operators can select which network hosts on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for
that service.
