When you deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry, you must create a statically defined network to host the component virtual
machines that constitute the Pivotal Cloud Foundry infrastructure.

Pivotal Cloud Foundry components, like the Cloud Controller and UAA, run on this infrastructure network.
In Pivotal Cloud Foundry v2.0 and earlier, on-demand Pivotal Cloud Foundry services require that you host them on a network that runs
separately from this network.

Cloud operators pre-provision service instances from Ops Manager. 
Then, for each service, Ops Manager allocates and recovers static IP addresses from a 
pre-defined block of addresses.

To enable on-demand services in Redis for PCF v2.0 and earlier, operators must create a service networks in
BOSH Director and select the **Service Network** checkbox. Operators then can select the
service network to host on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for that service.
