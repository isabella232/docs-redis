Perform the following procedures to create a UAA client for CredHub,
log in to CredHub, and provide or generate a CA certificate.

###<a id='uaa'></a> Create UAA Client

Perform the following steps to create a UAA client for CredHub on your UAA server:

1. Retrieve the IP address of the BOSH Director VM and the Director credentials
   by performing the steps in
   [Gather Credential and IP Address Information](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather).
   Both the UAA and CredHub servers are colocated on the BOSH Director VM.

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM by performing the steps in
   [SSH into Ops Manager of Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. From the Ops Manager VM, use the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC) to target
   the UAA server on the BOSH Director VM.
    In the UAAC command, specify the IP address for the BOSH Director VM, and
    port 8443.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:

    ```
    uaac target BOSH-DIRECTOR:8443
    ```
    <br>
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM.
    You retrieved this address from the **Status** tab of the BOSH Director
    tile in step 1.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac target 10.0.0.5:8443
    </pre>

1. In the **Credentials** tab of the BOSH Director tile, retrieve the
   **Uaa Login Client Credentials** and record the `identity` and `password` values.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: These are the credentials for the UAA
        server colocated on the BOSH Director, not the UAA server colocated on
        Pivotal Application Service.</p>

1. Retrieve the **Uaa Admin User Credentials** and record the `identity` and
`password` values.

1. From the Ops Manager VM, use the UAAC to get a token.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:

    ```
    uaac token owner get login --secret=UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-CRED
    ```
    Where `UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-CRED` is the `password` value of the **Uaa Login Client
    Credentials** that you retrieved in step 4.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac token owner get \
        login --secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>

1. When prompted for a user name and password, enter the values for `identity`
   and `password` of the **Uaa Admin User Credentials** you retrieved in step 5.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    User name:  admin
    Password:  ********************************
    </pre>

1. Add a UAA client for CredHub with the correct grants.
    <br><br>
    Enter the following command:

    ```
    uaac client add \
    	--authorized\_grant\_types client\_credentials \
    	--authorities credhub.read,credhub.write
    ```

1. When prompted for Client ID, enter `credhub`.
   When prompted for `New client secret`, enter a secure password of your choice.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Client ID:  credhub
    New client secret:  *******
    Verify new client secret:  *******
      scope: uaa.none
      client\_id: credhub
      resource\_ids: none
      authorized\_grant\_types: client\_credentials
      autoapprove:
      authorities: credhub.write credhub.read
      name: credhub
      required_user_groups:
      lastmodified: 1518198701452
      id: credhub
      created_by: f609e861-39ec-4a16-8aee-cba9e9b079e3
    </pre>

<%# (replace the link in this step with a link to Credhub documentation) %>
1. If you are using <%= vars.platform_old %> v1.12, perform the steps in [Downloading the CredHub CLI]
  to download the CredHub CLI on the Ops Manager VM.
  In <%= vars.platform_old %> v2.0 and later or <%= vars.platform_name %> 2.7 and later the Ops Manager VM ships with the CredHub CLI already
  installed.

###<a id='add-ca-cert'></a> Add the CA Certificate

Perform the following steps to log in to CredHub, provide or generate a CA
certificate, and add the certificate to Ops Manager:

1. From the Ops Manager VM, set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your CredHub
   server.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:

    ```
    credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
    <br>
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    </pre>

1. Log in to CredHub.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=credhub --client-secret=CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    <br>
    Where `client-secret` is the client secret you set in step 9 above.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    	--client-name=credhub \
    	--client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>

1. Use the CredHub CLI to generate a CA certificate or provide an existing one.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment may have multiple
        CA certificates.
       Pivotal recommends a dedicated CA certificate for services.</p>
	* If you do not have a CA certificate, use the CredHub CLI to generate one.
          Enter the following command:
		<pre class="terminal">
		$ credhub generate \
			--name="/services/tls_ca" \
			--type="certificate" \
			--is-ca \
            --common-name="rootCA"
		</pre>
    * If you have an existing CA certificate that you want to use, create a new
      file called `root.pem` with the contents of the certificate.
      Then enter the following command, specifying the path to `root.pem` and the
      private key for the certificate:
        <pre class="terminal">
        $ credhub set \
            --name="/services/tls_ca" \
            --type="certificate" \
            --certificate=./root.pem \
            --private=ERKSOSMFF...
        </pre>

1. Use the BOSH CLI v2 to extract the `certificate` portion from the CA certificate
   and print it.
    Run the following command:

    ```
    bosh int <(credhub get \
    --name=/services/tls_ca) \
    --path /value/certificate
    ```
1. Copy the output.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard** and select the BOSH Director tile.
   Click **Security**.

1. Paste the contents of the CA certificate into **Trusted Certificates** and
   click **Save**.

<%# (replace the links in this step with links to relevant installing/configuration topics) %>
1. After preparing your environment for TLS, you must enable TLS in the tile
   configuration while installing <%= vars.service_name %>:
    * **Existing Installation**: If you have already installed the
            <%= vars.service_name %> tile, perform the procedures in
			[Configure TLS] to enable TLS in the **Security** section of the tile.
			Then return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.
			This restarts all the VMs in your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment and applies your CA certificate.
    * **New Installation**: If you have not yet installed the <%= vars.service_name %>
            tile, perform all of the procedures in [Installing] <%= vars.service_name %>.
			When you click **Apply Changes**, this deploys <%= vars.service_name %>,
            restarts all the VMs in your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment, and applies your CA certificate.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>:
        Restarting all of the VMs in your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment in order to apply a CA
        certificate takes a long time to complete.</p>
