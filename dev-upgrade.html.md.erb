<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

If individual service instance upgrades are permitted by the operator, and a newer tile has been made available,
then developers may upgrade their own service instances by following the procedure here.
[Enable Individual Service Instance Upgrades](./upgrade.html#proced) describes how an operator enables developer upgrades of their own service instances.

The cf CLI, v6.46.0 or a more recent version, is a prerequisite for upgrading a <%= vars.product_name %> On-Demand Service Instance.

To upgrade a single service instance:

Confirm that an upgrade is available for the service instance; the upgrade is available when the upgrade available column of the output says yes, as in the sample output:

<pre>
$ cf services
Getting services in org system / space system as admin...

name   service      plan            last operation   broker            upgrade available
testSI p.redis      on-demand-cache create succeeded p.redis           yes
</pre>

Upgrade the service instance with a command of the form:
```
cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --upgrade
```
Replace `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name of the instance to be upgraded. Confirm that you want to update when prompted.
