<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> If you are using dedicated VMs then migrate to the on-demand service plan or back up data before upgrading to Redis for PCF v2.0 to prevent data loss in Redis deployments used as persistent storage.<br><br>
If you are upgrading from Redis for PCF v1.14.3 or earlier, you must run the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand after upgrading.
