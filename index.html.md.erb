##<a id="about-redis"></a> About Redis

<strong><em>Redis</em></strong> is an easy to use, high speed key-value store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.
It supports a range of data structures including strings, lists, hashes, sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes.
It is easy to install and configure and is popular with engineers as a straightforward NoSQL data store.
It is used for everything from a quick way to store data for development and testing through to enterprise-scale apps like Twitter.

## <a id="about"></a> About Redis for PCF

<strong><em>Redis for PCF</em></strong> packages Redis for easy deployment and operability on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

Redis for PCF v2.0 and later offers On-Demand and Shared-VM services.

* **On-Demand Service**---Provides a dedicated VM running a Redis instance.
  The operator can configure up to three plans with different configurations,
  memory sizes, and quotas.
  App developers can provision an instance for any of the On-Demand plans offered
  and configure certain Redis settings.

* **Shared-VM Service**---Provides support for a number of Redis instances running
  in a single VM.
  It is designed for testing and development purposes only, **do not use the
  Shared-VM service in production environments**.
  The Shared-VM instances are pre-provisioned by the operator with a fixed number
  of instances and memory size.
  App developers can then use one of these pre-provisioned instances.


<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong>
  If you use dedicated VMs, then migrate to the on-demand service plan
  or back up data before upgrading to Redis for PCF v2.0 to prevent data loss
  in Redis deployments used as persistent storage.<br><br>
  If you are upgrading from Redis for PCF v1.14.3 or earlier, you must run the
  <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand after upgrading.
</p>

* [On-Demand Service Offering](./architecture.html)
* [Shared-VM Service Offering](./architecture-pp.html)

##<a id="other-services"></a> Redis for PCF and Other PCF Services

As well as <%= vars.service_name %>, other <%= vars.platform_name %> services offer *on-demand* service plans.
These plans let developers provision service instances when they want.

These contrast with the older *pre-provisioned* service plans,
which require operators to provision the service instances during installation
and configuration through the service tile UI.

The following table lists which <%= vars.platform_name %> services offer on-demand
and pre-provisioned service plans:

For services that offer both on-demand and pre-provisioned plans, you can choose the
plan you want to use when configuring the tile.
