##<a id="about-redis"></a> About Redis

<strong><em>Redis</em></strong> is an easy to use, high speed key-value store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.
It supports a range of data structures including strings, lists, hashes, sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes.
It is easy to install and configure and is popular with engineers as a straightforward NoSQL data store.
It is used for everything from a quick way to store data for development and testing through to enterprise-scale apps like Twitter.

## <a id="about"></a> About Redis for PCF

<p class="note"><strong>Note:
Redis for PCF 1.13 is no longer supported because it has reached the
End of General Support phase.</strong>
To stay up to date with the latest software and security updates,
upgrade to a supported version.</p>

<strong><em>Redis for PCF</em></strong> packages Redis for easy deployment and operability on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

Redis for PCF offers On-Demand, Dedicated-VM, and Shared-VM services.

* **On-Demand Service**---Provides a dedicated VM running a Redis instance.
  The operator can configure up to three plans with different configurations, memory sizes, and quotas.
  App developers can provision an instance for any of the On-Demand plans offered and configure certain Redis settings.

* **Dedicated-VM Service**---Provides a dedicated VM running a Redis instance.
  The Dedicated-VM Service is pre-provisioned by the operator with a fixed number of VMs and memory size.
  App developers can then use one of those pre-provisioned VMs.

* **Shared-VM Service**---Provides support for a number of Redis instances running in a single VM. It is designed for testing and development.
  The Shared-VM instances are pre-configured by the
  operator with a max number of instances and memory size.
  App developers can then provision a Redis process.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: As of Redis for PCF v1.11,
    the on-demand service is at feature parity with the dedicated-VM service.
    The dedicated-VM service plan will be deprecated.
    Pivotal recommends using the on-demand service plan.</p>

For more information on the plans, see:
