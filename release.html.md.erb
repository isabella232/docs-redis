## <a id="200"></a> v2.0.0

**Release Date: XXX XX, 2018**

<%= partial 'breaking-change-dedicated-vms' %>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Dedicated-VM support is removed, see the Breaking Change above.
To install or upgrade the tile, operators must acknowledge the deletion of
dedicated-VMs using a checkbox.

- The Redis on-demand service broker now binds apps to a service instance using BOSH DNS.
Therefore, service bindings return the DNS address instead of the IP address.
To use BOSH DNS with existing bindings you must rebind your apps to on-demand service instances.

- Uses open source Redis v5.0.2, which includes a fix for a critical issue for users that
rely on streams.
For more information about Redis v5.0.2, see the
[Redis 5.0 release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES).

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`.
This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run rule.
For more information about this unexpected behavior, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).
