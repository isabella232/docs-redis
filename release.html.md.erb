## <a id="2-0-2"></a> v2.0.2

**Release Date: May 7, 2019**

### Feature

New feature in this release:

* A new errand is available to the operator: `recreate-all-service-instances`.
See [Post-Deploy Errands](./maintain.html#post-deploy).

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fixes:

* Redis for PCF uses open source Redis v5.0.4, which includes fixes for issues that caused crashes in very rare cases.<br>
For more information about Redis v5.0.4, see the
[Redis 5.0 release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES).
* Updates golang to v1.12.1, which includes a fix for a regression around sync
* Updates on-demand broker to v0.26.1, which contains a fix for the `recreate-all-service-instances` errand

### Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

* For PCF v2.4 and later, no metrics emitted from cf-redis-broker reached the metrics Firehose.
* Service Backups have been upgraded to v18.2, which contains a fix for an issue where up-to-date versions of `scp` no longer support path `.`
* The fields for AWS Secret Access Key pair required to set up S3 Backups were marked as text and not secret.<br>
These have now been updated so your S3 keys are masked. Pivotal recommends that you rotate your S3 credentials to ensure they are safe.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services.

## <a id="2-0-0"></a> v2.0.0

**Release Date: January 4, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Dedicated-VM support is removed, see the Breaking Change above.
To install or upgrade the tile, operators must acknowledge the deletion of
dedicated-VMs using a checkbox.

- The Redis on-demand service broker now binds apps to a service instance using BOSH DNS.
Therefore, service bindings return the DNS address instead of the IP address.
To use BOSH DNS with existing bindings you must rebind your apps to on-demand service instances.

- Redis for PCF uses open source Redis v5.0.2, which includes a fix for a critical issue for users that
rely on streams.
For more information about Redis v5.0.2, see the
[Redis 5.0 release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES).

- On-Demand Redis supports secure manifests, which avoids plaintext secrets in manifests
by passing these to the ODB to store in BOSH CredHub.

* Added error message and logging when a shared service instance is missing a PID.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* For PCF 2.4 and later, metrics emitted from cf-redis-broker do not reach the Loggregator Firehose.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`.
This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run rule.
For more information about this unexpected behavior, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).

* Service backups fail to upload backups when running on stemcell v170.30 and later.

* Configuring s3 service backups results in an error due to a non-configurable property.
