## <a id="210"></a> v2.1.0

**Release Date: MM DD, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* You can assign multiple AZs to on-demand plans. Instances of the plan are
randomly assigned across the selected AZs.

* The errands `recreate-all-service-instances` and
`find-orphan-on-demand-service-instances` are available to the operator.
For more information, see [Post-Deploy Errands](./maintain.html#post-deploy).

* Operators can enable BOSH HotSwaps, which reduces downtime for on-demand service
instance upgrades.
For more information, see [BOSH HotSwaps](./upgrade.html#osh-hotswaps).

### Security Fixes

* Redis for PCF uses open source Redis v5.0.3, which includes fixes for issues that could cause crashes in very rare cases.
For more information about Redis v5.0.3, see the
[Redis 5.0 release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES).

* All errands now use `tile_installer_client` for authentication, as opposed to `admin_credentials`.

### Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

* The redis-odb service broker listened on port `12345`, which was inconsistent
with other services.
It now uses the standard port `8080`.

* Upgrades for on-demand service instances failed after enabling Lua scripting.
These instances now get upgraded.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run rule.
For more information about this unexpected behavior, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).
