**Release Date: XXXX XX, 2020**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **Operators can select TLS versions for On-Demand Service Instances 
when TLS is enabled:** To select TLS versions, operators can follow the steps in 
 [Preparing for TLS](preparing-tls.html) and [Network Configuration](./installing.html#network-configuration). 
After selecting a TLS version, VMware recommends generating 
a new service key to reflect the updated TLS versions and rebinding the service instance
 with the new service key.

- **Operators can install Healthwatch:** Operators can only install Healthwatch v1.8 and later 
with the Redis tile.
