## <a id="1140"></a> v1.14.0

**Release Date: September XX, 2018**

###<a id="features1140"></a> Features

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>Redis for PCF v1.14 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.
You must manually download and import a new stemcell into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library before deploying Redis for PCF v1.14.0.
This might break automation you have set up to update Redis for PCF deployments that used Trusty stemcells. 
To download the Xenial stemcell from Pivotal Network,
go to <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial"> Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)</a>.
For instructions on importing the stemcell, see <a href="./installing.html#stemcell"> Update Stemcell</a>.</p>

New features and changes in this release:

* Support for the Log Cache cf CLI plugin, which enables developers
to access logs for an on-demand service instance using the command `cf tail`.
For more information, see [Access Redis Metrics for On-Demand Service Instances](./using.html#logging).

* A new **Deprecate Dedicated-VM Plan** errand disables service access
to  the dedicated-VM plan for non-admin app developers.
Run this errand to prepare for deprecation of support for dedicated nodes.
For more information, see [Post-Deploy Errands](./maintain.html#post-deploy).

* In addition to registering the cf-redis-broker with PCF,
the **Broker Registrar** errand now disables service access to
the dedicated-VM plan for non-admin app developers.
For information, see [Post-Deploy Errands](./maintain.html#post-deploy).

* Adds a **Delete All Dedicated Instances** checkbox to the tile in the
**Warning - Deprecating Dedicated** tab, for operators to remove all dedicated
nodes ahead of the upcoming removal of support for dedicated nodes.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
        For PCF v2.2, after you select the <strong>Delete All Dedicated Instances</strong> checkbox
        and before you click <strong>Apply Changes</strong>, the Resource Config
        tab cannot be changed and displays the warning <code>Please review the errors below</code>.
        You can safely ignore this warning. </p>

* Adds a **Cleanup Metadata if Dedicated-VM Plan Disabled** errand that cleans up any
metadata in PCF for any dedicated-VM service instances if zero dedicated instances are provisioned. For
more information, see [Post-Deploy Errands](./maintain.html#post-deploy).

* Redis on-demand instance processes and cf-redis-broker routing processes are now wrapped in the BOSH Process Manager (bpm).
For more information about bpm, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/bpm/bpm/).

* The major stemcell line is now Ubuntu Xenial. See [Breaking Change](#features1140) above.

###<a id="known1140"></a> Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`.
This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run rule.
For more information about this unexpected behavior, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).
