This section contains the upgrade procedure and upgrade paths for Redis for PCF.

##<a id="upgrading"></a> Compatible Upgrade Paths

Before upgrading Redis for PCF, for compatibility information, see the
[Product Version Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="upgrades"></a>Upgrade to Redis for PCF v2.1

<div class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking change</strong>:
  During the upgrade from Redis for PCF v2.0, on-demand service instances change
  their port from <code>12345</code> to <code>8080</code> to be consistent with other services.
  If you are upgrading from v2.0, you must follow the steps below or your instances will fail.</div>

This product enables a reliable upgrade experience between versions of the product
deployed through Ops Manager.

For information on the upgrade paths for each released version, see
[Compatible Upgrade Paths](#upgrading) above.

### Downtime During Upgrade

During the upgrade each Redis instance experiences a small period of
downtime as each instance is updated with the new software components.
This downtime is because Redis instances are single VMs operating in a non-high availability (HA) setup.
To reduce downtime, you can enable the BOSH HotSwaps feature.
Compared to traditional BOSH upgrades, this feature has been shown to reduce downtime by 75%.
For instructions on how to enable this feature, see [BOSH HotSwaps](#bosh-hotswaps) below.

The length of downtime depends on whether there is a stemcell update to
replace the operating system image, or whether the Redis software is updated the
on the existing VM.
Stemcell updates incur additional downtime while the IaaS creates the new VM,
whereas updates without a stemcell update are faster.

Ops Manager ensures the instances are updated with the new packages and any
configuration changes are applied automatically.

Upgrading to a newer version of the product does not cause any loss of data or configuration.

### Upgrade Procedure

To upgrade to Redis for PCF v2.1, do the following:

1. Download the latest version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis).

1. Upload the new `.pivotal` file to Ops Manager.

1. If required, upload the stemcell associated with the update.

1. If required, update any new mandatory configuration parameters.

1. If you are upgrading from v2.0, it will be necessary to select one or more AZs for each On-Demand plan to deploy instances in.

1. If you are upgrading from v2.0, open your security group ports to both `12345`
and `8080`.
This for the broker to change its default port to `8080`, to be consistent with
other services.

1. Pivotal recommends that you ensure that the **Upgrade All On-Demand Service Instances**
errand checkbox is selected on the **Review Pending Changes** page.

    <p class="note"> <strong>Note:</strong>
      Existing service instances are not upgraded if you do not run this errand.
      These instances do not benefit from any security fixes or new features
      included in the upgrade. </p>

1. Click **Apply changes**. The rest of the process is automated.

1. After the upgrade, remove access to port `12345` from the security group.

##  <a id="downtime"></a> Downtime During Upgrades and Redeploys

A redeploy causes downtime of the Redis for PCF tile.
This section clarifies what events trigger a redeploy.

### <a id="opsman"></a> Ops Manager Changes

In Ops Manager, any field that changes the manifest causes a redeploy of the Redis for PCF tile.

### <a id="pas"></a> PAS Changes

In the Pivotal Application Service (PAS), changes to any of the following properties can trigger downtime:
<ul>
  <li><code>..cf.consul\_server.ips</code>---Consul Server Resource Config </li>
  <li><code>$runtime.system\_domain</code>---Runtime System Domain </li>
  <li><code>..cf.ha\_proxy.skip\_cert\_verify.value</code>---Disable SSL
    certificate verification for this environment in PAS
</li>
  <li><code>$runtime.apps\_domain</code>---Runtime Apps Domain </li>
  <li><code>..cf.nats.ips</code>---NATS Resource Config </li>
  <li><code>$self.service\_network</code>---Service Networks in Ops Manager
</li>
</ul>

When the operator applies any of the above changes to PAS, downtime is triggered for the following:

* Redis On-Demand Broker in Redis for PCF v1.8 and later

* Shared-VM Services in Redis for PCF v1.9 and earlier


### <a id="all-instances"></a> Upgrading all Service Instances

* For Redis for PCF v1.8 and later, downtime for service instances occurs only
after the operator runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand, after all tile upgrades are completed successfully.

* Any change to a field on the Redis for PCF tile causes BOSH to redeploy both the legacy
and the on-demand Redis Brokers after the operator runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand.


### <a id="bosh-hotswaps"></a> BOSH HotSwaps

Enabling BOSH HotSwaps reduces the downtime for on-demand service instances when
upgrading.
Benchmarking shows that enabling BOSH HotSwaps can reduce service instance downtime
by 75% when upgrading.
For how it works, see
<a href="https://bosh.io/docs/changing-deployment-vm-strategy/">Changing VM Update Strategy</a>
in the BOSH documentation.
To use this feature, all service bindings must use BOSH DNS instead of IP addresses.

To enable BOSH HotSwaps, do the following:

1. Ensure all service bindings use BOSH DNS.
To do so, tell developers to unbind, bind, and restage any apps created while
Redis for PCF v1.14 or earlier was installed.
For instructions, see the solution in [Apps Fail to Connect to the Service Instance](./troubleshoot-instances.html#connect-fails).
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
    You must do this before enabling BOSH HotSwaps.
    Any apps with service bindings that do not use BOSH DNS fail to connect
    to the Redis service instance.</p>

1. Select the **BOSH HotSwaps** checkbox in the **On-Demand Service Settings** tab.

1. Click **Save** and **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="network-upgrades"></a> Network Changes after Deployment

This section explains how changing the network after deploying Redis for PCF
affects instances and apps.

### <a id="network-upgrades-shared-vms"></a> Shared VMs

To change the network for shared-VM services,
click **Assign AZs and Networks** in the Redis for PCF tile configuration and use the **Network** dropdown.

You can also change the network by altering the CIDR in the BOSH Director tile.

Pivotal discourages changing the network that a pre-existing shared-VM deployment works with.

If the network is changed, app bindings for existing shared-VM instances might stop working.

### <a id="network-upgrades-on-demand"></a> On-Demand Service Instances

To change the service network for on-demand service instances,
click **Assign AZs and Networks** in the Redis tile configuration and use the **Service Network** dropdown.
The service network applies to on-demand service instances.

You can also change the service network by altering the CIDR in the BOSH Director tile.

If you change the service network, you must unbind and rebind existing apps to the on-demand Redis instance.

New on-demand service instances are placed into the new service network,
but existing on-demand service instances are not moved.
If you need to move the data in on-demand Redis instances to a new service network, you must create a new instance, migrate the data manually, and delete the old instance.

Similarly, changing the availability zone for an on-demand plan only applies to new on-demand instances
and does not alter existing instances.
