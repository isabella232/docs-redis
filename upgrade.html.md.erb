This section contains the upgrade procedure and upgrade paths for Redis for PCF.


##<a id="upgrading"></a> Compatible Upgrade Paths

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>Redis for PCF v1.14 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.
You must manually download and import a new stemcell into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library before deploying Redis for PCF 1.14.0.
This might break automation you have set up to update Redis for PCF deployments that used Trusty stemcells.
To download the Xenial stemcell from Pivotal Network, click <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial"> Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)</a>.</p>


Consider the following compatibility information before upgrading Redis for PCF.

## <a id="update-addons"></a>Update Add-ons to Run with Xenial Stemcell

Redis for PCF 1.4 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.
If you are using any of the following BOSH add-ons with your PCF deployment,
you must update the add-on definition to include the Xenial stemcell before you deploy Redis for PCF 1.14:

+ File Integrity Monitoring for PCF Add-on. For update instructions, see [Updating FIM Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim/updating-for-xenial.html).
+ ClamAV for PCF Add-on. For update instructions, see [Updating ClamAV Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-antivirus/updating-for-xenial.html).
+ IPsec for PCF Add-on. For update instructions, see [Updating IPsec Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/updating-for-xenial.html).


## <a id="upgrades"></a>Upgrade to Redis for PCF 1.14.0

This product enables a reliable upgrade experience between versions of the product that is deployed through Ops Manager.

For information on the upgrade paths for each released version, see the above table.

To upgrade Redis for PCF 1.14.0, do the following:

1. Download the Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial),
and import it into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library. For instructions, see [Update Stemcell](./installing.html#stemcell).
1. Download the latest version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis).
1. Upload the new `.pivotal` file to Ops Manager.
1. If required, upload the stemcell associated with the update.
1. If required, update any new mandatory configuration parameters.
1. Click **Apply changes**. The rest of the process is automated.

During the upgrade deployment each Redis instance experiences a small period of downtime as each Redis instance is updated with the new software components. This downtime is because the Redis instances are single VMs operating in a non HA setup.

The length of the downtime depends on whether there is a stemcell update to replace the operating system image, or whether the existing VM can simply have the redis software updated. Stemcell updates incur additional downtime while the IaaS creates the new VM, whereas updates without a stemcell update are faster.

Ops Manager ensures the instances are updated with the new packages and any configuration changes are applied automatically.

Upgrading to a newer version of the product does not cause any loss of data or configuration.

##  <a id="downtime"></a> Downtime During Upgrades and Redeploys

A redeploy causes downtime of the Redis for PCF tile.
This section clarifies what events trigger a redeploy.

### <a id="opsman"></a> Ops Manager Changes

In Ops Manager, any field that changes the manifest causes a redeploy of the Redis for PCF tile.

### <a id="pas"></a> PAS (or Elastic Runtime) Changes

In the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime, changes to any of the following properties can trigger downtime:
<ul>
  <li><code>..cf.consul\_server.ips</code>---Consul Server Resource Config </li>
  <li><code>$runtime.system\_domain</code>---Runtime System Domain </li>
  <li><code>..cf.ha\_proxy.skip\_cert\_verify.value</code>---Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment in PAS (or Elastic Runtime)
</li>
  <li><code>$runtime.apps\_domain</code>---Runtime Apps Domain </li>
  <li><code>..cf.nats.ips</code>---NATS Resource Config
</li>
  <li><code>$self.service\_network</code>---Service Networks in Ops Manager
</li>
</ul>

When the operator applies any of the above changes to PAS (or Elastic Runtime), downtime is triggered for the following:

* Redis On-Demand Broker in Redis for PCF v1.8 and later

* Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM Services in Redis for PCF v1.9 and earlier


### <a id="all-instances"></a> Upgrading all Service Instances

* For Redis for PCF v1.8 and later, downtime for service instances occurs only
after the operator runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand, after all tile upgrades are completed successfully.

* Any change to a field on the Redis for PCF tile causes BOSH to redeploy both the legacy
and the on-demand Redis Brokers after the operator runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand.


## <a id="network-upgrades"></a> Network Changes after Deployment

This section explains how changing the network after deploying Redis for PCF
affects instances and apps.

### <a id="network-upgrades-dedicated-shared-vms"></a> Dedicated and Shared VMs

To change the network for dedicated-VM and shared-VM services,
click **Assign AZs and Networks** in the Redis for PCF tile configuration and use the **Network** dropdown.
The network applies to both shared-VM and dedicated-VM services.

You can also change the network by altering the CIDR in the Ops Manager Director tile.

Pivotal discourages changing the network that a pre-existing dedicated-VM deployment or shared-VM deployment works with.

If the network is changed, app bindings for existing dedicated-VM and shared-VM instances might stop working.
Dedicated-VMs might also be reallocated as new service instances without their data being cleaned,
resulting in a data leak between apps.

### <a id="network-upgrades-on-demand"></a> On-Demand Service Instances

To change the service network for on-demand service instances,
click **Assign AZs and Networks** in the Redis tile configuration and use the **Service Network** dropdown.
The service network applies to on-demand service instances.

You can also change the service network by altering the CIDR in the Ops Manager Director tile.

If you change the service network, you must unbind and rebind existing apps to the on-demand Redis instance.

New on-demand service instances are placed into the new service network,
but existing on-demand service instances are not moved.
If you need to move the data in on-demand Redis instances to a new service network, you must create a new instance, migrate the data manually, and delete the old instance.

Similarly, changing the availability zone for an on-demand plan only applies to new on-demand instances
and does not alter existing instances.

## <a id="policy"></a> Release Policy

When a new version of Redis is released, Pivotal aims to release a new version of Redis for PCF containing the new Redis version soon after.

When a new version of Redis or another dependent software component, such as the stemcell, is released due to a critical CVE, Pivotal's goal is to release a new version of the Redis for PCF within 48 hours.
