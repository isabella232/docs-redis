This section contains the upgrade procedure and upgrade paths for Redis for PCF.

## <a id="upgrading"></a>Compatible Upgrade Paths

Before upgrading Redis for PCF, for compatibility information, see the [Product Version Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="upgrades"></a>Upgrade Redis for PCF

This product enables a reliable upgrade experience between versions of the product that is deployed through Ops Manager.

For information on the upgrade paths for each released version, see the above table.

To upgrade Redis for PCF, do the following:

1. Download the latest version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis).
1. Upload the new `.pivotal` file to Ops Manager.
1. If required, upload the stemcell associated with the update.
1. If required, update any new mandatory configuration parameters.
1. Click **Apply changes**. The rest of the process is automated.

During the upgrade deployment, each Redis instance experiences a small period of downtime as each Redis instance is updated with the new software components. This downtime is because the Redis instances are single VMs operating in a non HA setup.

The length of the downtime depends on whether there is a stemcell update to replace the operating system image, or whether the existing VM can simply have the redis software updated. Stemcell updates incur additional downtime while the IaaS creates the new VM, whereas updates without a stemcell update are faster.

Ops Manager ensures the instances are updated with the new packages and any configuration changes are applied automatically.

Upgrading to a newer version of the product does not cause any loss of data or configuration.

## <a id="downtime"></a> Downtime During Upgrades and Redeploys

A redeploy causes downtime of the Redis for PCF tile.
This section clarifies what events trigger a redeploy.

### <a id="opsman"></a> Ops Manager Changes

In Ops Manager, any field that changes the manifest causes a redeploy of the Redis for PCF tile.

### <a id="pas"></a> PAS (or Elastic Runtime) Changes

In Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime, changes to any of the following properties can trigger downtime:

* `..cf.consul_server.ips`: Consul Server Resource Config
* `$runtime.system_domain`: Runtime System Domain
* `..cf.ha_proxy.skip_cert_verify.value`: Disable SSL certificate validation for this environment in PAS or Elastic Runtime
* `$runtime.apps_domain`: Runtime Apps Domain
* `..cf.nats.ips`: NATS Resource Config
* `$self.service_network`: Service Network in Ops Manager

When the operator applies any of the above changes to PAS or Elastic Runtime, downtime is triggered
for the following:

* Redis On-Demand Broker in Redis for PCF v1.8 and later
* Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM Services in Redis for PVF v1.9 and earlier

## <a id="all-instances"></a> Upgrading All Service Instances

* For Redis for PCF v1.8 and later, downtime for service instances occurs only after the operator
runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand, after all tile upgrades are completed
successfully.

* Any change to a field on the Redis for PCF tile causes BOSH to redeploy both the legacy and the
on-demand Redis Brokers after the operator runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand.

## <a id="network-upgrades"></a> Network Changes After Deployment

This section explains how changing the network after deploying Redis for PCF affects instances and
apps.
