## <a id="upgrading"></a>Compatible Upgrade Paths

Before upgrading Redis for PCF, for compatibility information, see the [Product Version Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="upgrades"></a>Upgrade Redis for PCF

This product enables a reliable upgrade experience between versions of the product that is deployed through Ops Manager.

For information on the upgrade paths for each released version, see the above table.

To upgrade Redis for PCF, do the following:

1. Download the latest version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis).
1. Upload the new `.pivotal` file to Ops Manager.
1. If required, upload the stemcell associated with the update.
1. If required, update any new mandatory configuration parameters.
1. Click **Apply changes**. The rest of the process is automated.

During the upgrade deployment, each Redis instance experiences a small period of downtime as each Redis instance is updated with the new software components. This downtime is because the Redis instances are single VMs operating in a non HA setup.

The length of the downtime depends on whether there is a stemcell update to replace the operating system image, or whether the existing VM can simply have the redis software updated. Stemcell updates incur additional downtime while the IaaS creates the new VM, whereas updates without a stemcell update are faster.

Ops Manager ensures the instances are updated with the new packages and any configuration changes are applied automatically.

Upgrading to a newer version of the product does not cause any loss of data or configuration.
