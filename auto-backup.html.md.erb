## <a id="backup"></a>Creating Backups of Redis Instances

You can configure automatic backups for all service plan types: on-demand, dedicated-VM, and shared-VM.

The key features are:

* Backups run on a configurable schedule.
* Every instance is backed up.
* The Redis broker statefile is backed up.
* For each backup artefact, a file is created that contains the MD5 checksum for that artifact. This can be used to validate that the artefact is not corrupted.
* You can configure AWS S3, SCP, Azure, or Google Cloud Storage as your destination.
* Data from Redis is flushed to disk before the backup is started by running a `BGSAVE` on each instance.
* Backups are labelled:
  * For dedicated-VM and shared-VM plans: with timestamp, instance GUID and plan name. Files are stored by date.
  * For on-demand plans: with timestamp and plan name. Files are stored by deployment, then date.

## <a id="configuration"></a>Configuring Backups
To enable backups, you will first need to choose your backup destination type - AWS S3, SCP, Azure or Google Cloud Storage.

Click on the tile in Ops Manager, followed by the `Backups` link on the left-hand menu.

### <a id="aws"></a>AWS IAM Policy
An AWS IAM policy describes the permissions related to your bucket.
The minimum set of policies required in order to upload the backup files are:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
Notes:

* Make sure to replace `<bucket-name>` with your correct values.
* `s3:CreateBucket` is only required if the S3 bucket does not exist.
* The additional `s3:CreateBucket` action is also required if the S3 bucket does not exist.

#### Notes

For each backup destination, the field `Backup timeout` causes backups to fail after a configured timeout.
Redis' BGSAVE will continue but backups will not be uploaded to destinatons if this timeout is hit.

You might want to do a manual backup before doing a procedure that might cause data loss.

To back up or restore Redis manually, see [Manually Backing Up and Restoring Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry]
